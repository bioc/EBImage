Major changes since EBImage 2.6.0

1) Slots
The slots 'filename', 'compression', 'resolution', and 'features' have been removed 
since they are not intrisic properties of images. Only the slot 'colormode' has been
kept to help EBImage functions to know how to render Image objects.

2) TrueColor mode
This color mode 'TrueColor' is now deprecated and will be defunct in the next 
Bioconductor release. In this color mode, color pixels were stored as integers and 
resulting matrices didn't constitute a mathematical field anymore, breaking all
the compatibility with basic mathematical operators and R commands. Please use 
the color mode 'Color' instead. In this mode, color RGB channels are stored in 
the third dimension and are more natural to process with R.

3) Image object, arrays and dimensions
All EBImage functions now work with Image objects and arrays having more than
2 dimensions. Extra dimensions are used to store image stacks and image color 
channels. Storage mode can be 'integer', 'numeric' or 'logical'.

4) All S4 methods removed
All EBImage functions are now R functions, not anymore S4 methods.

5) Testing procedure
All EBImage functions are now tested during 'R CMD check' with several types of
multi-dimensional matrices/arrays/Image objects, with several storage modes.

6) Deprecation
28 EBImage functions have been deprecated, mostly functions coming from ImageMagick 
because they were poorly documented (even in the ImageMagick documentation !)
and/or not useful aynmore (eg. negate(x) could be replaced by 1-x ; mkball, mkbox and
morphKern have been fused in makeBrush ; normalize2 is now replaced by normalize, 
etc...)

7) Attribute deprecation
Many attributes have been deprecated since they were poorly documented, useless in 
the new framework or too vague to be kept. Many unnecessary '...' arguments have been 
removed.

8) Many bug fixes and speeding issues resolved
distmap, readImage, watershed, display and many more. See the DONE file.

9) New features/functions added
display, ocontour, bwlabel, makeBrush

10) IndexedImage class
This class doesn't exist aynmore. All EBImage functions are now able to work
on arrays.
