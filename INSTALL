1. UNIX/Linux 

EBImage requires the following softwares to be installed:
1) pkg-config
2) gtk+-2.0
3) ImageMagick

On UNIX/Linux systems, pkg-config and gtk+-2.0 are most likely present. 
ImageMagick is available in many UNIX distributions (Ubuntu,
Debian, Fedora, Suse). Alternatively, you may download and compile it 
from 'http://www.imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php#unix'.

Please note that the development versions (with C header and libraries) of 
gtk+-2.0 and ImageMagick are needed to install EBImage.

Just download and install the package EBImage from Bioconductor then or do
a "biocLite('EBImage')" in R or "R CMD INSTALL ." in a terminal located in
a the EBImage package directory to install EBImage.

EBImage works fine with gtk+-2.0 2.12.9 and ImageMagick 6.3.7 Q16.

2. MacOS installation

EBImage requires the following softwares to be installed:
1) pkg-config
2) gtk+-2.0
3) ImageMagick

These softwares can be easily installed with the MacPorts package management
software, available at 'http://www.macports.org/'. To install MacPorts, 
you'll first need to install the XCode developement suite and the X11 SDK.
These tools are located in the DVDs shipped with your Mac.

Next, the packages 'gtk+-2.0' and 'ImageMagick' are installed by simply 
typing the commands 'sudo port install ImageMagick' and 'sudo port install gtk2' 
in a terminal. The package 'pkg-config' will be automatically installed as a
dependency of 'gtk+-2.0'.

Download the latest **SOURCE** package of EBImage at
http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.4/bioc/html/EBImage.html
and install it by just typing 'R CMD INSTALL .' in a terminal. 

Before using EBImage, you'll have to start the X11 server located 
in the Application/Utilities directory. Start R and type 
'library(EBImage) ; example(EBImage)' to check whether everything
went fine.

3. Windows installation

EBImage requires the following softwares to be installed:
1) gtk+-2.0
2) ImageMagick

The gtk+-2.0 bundle can be downloaded from 'http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.16/gtk+-bundle_2.16.0-20090317_win32.zip'
or 'http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html' (select the binary GTK+ all-in-one bundle).
Please install it somewhere ('C:\gtk', for example) and add the 'C:\gtk\bin' path to the 
system environment PATH variable by editing the tab 'System/Advanced/Environment variables' 
of the 'My computer' desktop icon properties.

ImageMagick can be downloaded from 'http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows'. 
Select the Q16 DLL version and install it on your computer. The checkboxes 'Update executable search 
path' and 'Install developement headers and libraries' must be checked on.

EBImage works fine with gtk+-2.0 2.12.9 and ImageMagick 6.3.7 Q16.

Please note that on some older Window systems, you may see a runtime error stating that 'an application
has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly'. This is an ImageMagick related issue 
which can be fixed by downloading the Microsoft VC++ 2008 Redistributable Package here:
